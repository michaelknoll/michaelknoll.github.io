Recently I was asked for recommendations for how to help kids (age 8 and 10 years old) to start with computer programming. My first intuition was Lego Mindstorms and Fischertechnik Robotics, but additionally I asked the following question on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">dear twitter friends: do you have any recommendations for kits / software / platforms to learn <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coding</a> with / for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kids?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#kids</a>? they are 8 and 10 yrs old and parents asked me for advice. thanks a lot!</p>&mdash; Michael Lihs (@kaktusmimi) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaktusmimi/status/955533637046456320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2018</a></blockquote>

The response to this tweet was overwhelming so I thought it's time to write a little blog post.
