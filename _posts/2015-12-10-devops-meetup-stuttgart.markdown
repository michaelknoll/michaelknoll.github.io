On December, 16th 16 IT professionals from the Stuttgart area met at an office of Bosch in Vaihingen to talk about **DevOps in  Big Companies**. Find some minutes of the Meetup here. Since we agreed upon not mentioning any company names or people in summaries or blog posts for enabling an open discussion - the content of this post is "anonymous" (see [Chatham House Rule]).



Introduction Presentation
-------------------------

After a short introduction of the attendees we started with a presentation about how DevOps was "kick-started" at a huge Software Company. Here are some notes:

* Top Management wanted to become a "DevOps Company" so there was great support from this side
* Developers also wanted to become more agile and implement DevOps
* Driven by "Cloud Development" happening around them
* Tricky part: the "in-between management" (between developers and top-management)
* Conduction of a DevOps Workshop with a trainer and developers, operations and management
* Making a gap-analysis: where are we now, what are the biggest problems, where do we want to be
* Create a prioritized list of issues to work on from this gap analysis
* Build up a culture and values
* Establish continuous delivery for software and feedback loops
* Establish DevOps communities within the company with regular (monthly) meetings



Discussion
----------

Following the presentation there was a discussion about the experience of the other attendees concerning DevOps topics. Here's a short summary:

* Many well-established, hence "old" companies want to become an IT / Software company. It is hard to establish a new culture (e.g. Agility or DevOps) with the "old" set of people and management.
* Agile principles and culture makes a lot of the established hierarchies unnecessary. Roles change and deciders (managers) should rather become enablers and supporters (servant leaders)	.
* In big companies, internal IT is often too slow to meet the demands of innovative teams that want to experiment and build prototypes. People rather use external services e.g. AWS.
* Many prototypes start in a DevOps setup, which gets lost, once the application is taken over by the company processes. Afterwards, heavyweight company processes are applied and DevOps is dead.
* DevOps often starts as a grass-roots movement and comes from the people who do things rather then from management (bottom-up instead of top-down).
* There rarely are any "hard-metrics" or numbers by which you can measure success or failure when rolling out DevOps. It's rather the working conditions that change. Things to measure are maybe time-to-production of new features and number of "on-duty" calls for operations.
* Systems became very complex so that sometimes you cannot even make root cause analysis since there is no single root cause but rather a bundle of reasons why something went wrong.
* It's not about technology it's more about the mindset.
* Developers are often attracted by DevOps, operations people are more sceptical and rather want to continue working in the same setting they're used to.
* Fast release cycles (as favored by developers) mean constant change in systems, which ultimately means instability, seen as a reason for failure and incidents by operations.
* Big companies often do not manage risk but rather avoid it. Contradicts the fact that innovation means taking risks.
* It takes people that take (personal) risks with a clear vision to change things - even big companies allows them to do so.



Next DevOps Stutgart Meetups
----------------------------

We agreed upon a bi-monthly date for the Meetup. There shall be a mixture of technical and non-technical topics and if we talk about technology we will also take a look at how it affects the collaboration of the people involved. For the next Meetup around beginning of February we are still looking for a place to meet and a topic. Presentations should be held as an entry point for further discussion and take about 45min.
