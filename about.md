Welcome to my blog! My name is Michael Lihs and I live in Stuttgart, Germany. The topics on this blog originate from some of my professional and leisure activities.

In October 2019 I joined [ThoughtWorks] in Stuttgart as an Infrastructure Consultant. In my current project I mainly work with

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Golang](https://golang.org/)
* [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)
* [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

Previously, I worked at [punkt.de] and [Bosch]:

* [Spring-Boot] development with Java
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with [Jenkins] and [Concourse]
* Cloud Computing with [Cloud Foundry] and [BOSH]
* DevOps stuff with [Docker], [Vagrant], [Chef] and [Berkshelf]
* [TYPO3 CMS] and [Flow] Backend development
* [solr search] integration
* Quality Assurance and Testing with [Behat] and [Jenkins]

In my blog posts I want to share some of my experience with those tools and provide some best practices.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me any time.
