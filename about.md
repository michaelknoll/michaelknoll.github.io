Welcome to my blog! My name is Michael Lihs and I live in Karlsruhe, Germany. The topics on this blog origin from some of my professional and leisure activities.

Currently I'm working for a company called [punkt.de](http://www.punkt.de) in Karlsruhe and mainly do

* [TYPO3 CMS](http://www.typo3.org) and [TYPO3 Flow](http://flow.typo3.org) Backend development
* [solr search](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) integration
* Quality Assurance and Testing with [Behat](http://behat.org)
* DevOps stuff with [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), [Chef](http://chef.io) and [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com)

In my blog posts I want to share some of my experience with those tools and provide some best practices.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me any time.
