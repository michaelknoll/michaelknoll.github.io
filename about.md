Welcome to my blog! My name is Michael Lihs and I live in Karlsruhe, Germany. The topics on this blog originate from some of my professional and leisure activities.

Currently I'm working for a company called [punkt.de] in Karlsruhe and mainly do

* [TYPO3 CMS] and [TYPO3 Flow] Backend development
* [solr search] integration
* Quality Assurance and Testing with [Behat] and [Jenkins]
* DevOps stuff with [Vagrant], [Chef] and [Berkshelf]

In my blog posts I want to share some of my experience with those tools and provide some best practices.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me any time.
