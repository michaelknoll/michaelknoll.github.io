Welcome to my blog! My name is Michael Lihs and I live in Stuttgart, Germany. The topics on this blog originate from some of my professional and leisure activities.

At my current job as a web service developer at Bosch I mainly do

* [Spring-Boot] and development with Java
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with [Jenkins]
* Cloud Computing with [Cloud Foundry] and [BOSH]
* DevOps stuff with [Docker], [Vagrant], [Chef] and [Berkshelf]

Previously, I worked with:

* [TYPO3 CMS] and [TYPO3 Flow] Backend development
* [solr search] integration
* Quality Assurance and Testing with [Behat] and [Jenkins]

In my blog posts I want to share some of my experience with those tools and provide some best practices.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me any time.
